# EES_Delta_Survey_Test QGIS
 EES Delta Survey data for the pilot project comprising the 11 Delta Survey sites in the Gharbiya Governorate. This pilot project was completed in summer 2024. All the data is taken from the EES Delta Survey data (https://www.ees.ac.uk/our-cause/research/delta-survey.html) and the accompanying publication. J. Spencer 2024. _Archaeological Sites of the Nile Delta of Egypt: A gazetteer_. Egypt Exploration Society Memoirs 119. Egypt Exploration Society: London. The data is used here to test the QGIS2Web plugin of QGIS 3 for the purposes of creating a web-map including point data with image attributes. 
 
 The data is presented here strictly for comparison with the ArcGIS Online product, for the benefit of reviewers, colleagues and others who may wish to see how a QGIS derived web-map compares to the ArcGIS Online version.
